Filter Sphere is a powerful and flexible library for creating dynamic filtering interfaces in your web applications. It provides a set of tools and components to help you build intuitive and customizable filtering experiences for your users.

Here is a minimal example:

```jsx live props={{ "client:load": true }}
import {
  FilterSphereProvider,
  FilterBuilder,
  useFilterSphere,
} from "@fn-sphere/filter";
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});

export default () => {
  const { filterRule, predicate, context } = useFilterSphere({ schema });
  return (
    <FilterSphereProvider context={context}>
      <FilterBuilder />
      <button onClick={() => console.log(filterRule, predicate)}>Log</button>
    </FilterSphereProvider>
  );
};
```
