Filter Sphere is a powerful and flexible library for creating dynamic filtering interfaces in your web applications. It provides a set of tools and components to help you build intuitive and customizable filtering interfaces.

Here's a basic example:

import { AdvancedFilter } from "/src/components/intro-example/code";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import importedCode from "/src/components/intro-example/code?raw";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <AdvancedFilter client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    <Code code={importedCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
