Thanks to Filter Sphere being schema-driven and TypeScript-first, it works great with AI coding agents.

## Skills

Filter Sphere provides official [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for AI coding agents, enabling them to understand Filter Sphere's API, patterns, and best practices when helping you build filtering and sorting interfaces.

### Installation

Install the Filter Sphere skill to your AI coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add lawvs/fn-sphere
```

The source code of the skill is [here](https://github.com/lawvs/fn-sphere/tree/main/skills/filter-sphere).

### Example Prompts

Once installed, you can ask agents to help with various Filter Sphere tasks:

```
Add a filter UI to my data table using Filter Sphere
```

```
Create a custom filter function that checks if a string matches a regex pattern for use in Filter Sphere
```

```
Add localization support to my filter builder with English and Chinese in Filter Sphere
```

### What's Included

The Filter Sphere skill provides knowledge about:

- Zod schema definition and field discovery
- Filter and sort sphere creation (`createFilterSphere`, `createSorterSphere`)
- Preset functions (`presetFilter`, `presetSort`)
- Custom function authoring (`defineTypedFn`, `defineGenericFn`)
- React integration (`useFilterSphere`, `FilterBuilder`, themes, localization)
- Filter rule composition (single filters, groups with and/or logic)
- Multi-field sorting with asc/desc support
- Recommended project structure and best practices
